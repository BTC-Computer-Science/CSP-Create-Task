# Flag Project Practice Task
## Written Responses

**2a.** Provide a written response or audio narration in your video that:
* identifies the programming language;
* identifies the purpose of your program; and
* explains what the video illustrates.
_(Must not exceed 150 words)_
 
 
This program was written in ...

The purpose of my program is ...

The video of this program demonstrates ...
 
 
**2b.** Describe the incremental and iterative development process of your program, focusing on two distinct points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated. In your description clearly indicate whether the development described was collaborative or independent. At least one of these points must refer to independent program development. _(Must not exceed 200 words)_

> This prompt is skipped in the practice task.

**2c.** Capture and paste a program code segment that implements an algorithm
(marked with an oval in section 3 below) and that is fundamental for your
program to achieve its intended purpose. This code segment must be an
algorithm you developed individually on your own, must include two or more
algorithms, and must integrate mathematical and/or logical concepts. Describe
how each algorithm within your selected algorithm functions independently,
as well as in combination with others, to form a new algorithm that helps to
achieve the intended purpose of the program. _(Must not exceed 200 words)_


----

_Paste your program segmet here. This must be a part of your program that includes at least two other parts._

----

Describe the function of the algorithms.

Describe what the algorithm does in relation to the overall purpose of the program.

Describe how one of the algorithms functions independently.


**2d.** Capture and paste a program code segment that contains an abstraction you
developed individually on your own (marked with a rectangle in section 3
below). This abstraction must integrate mathematical and logical concepts.
Explain how your abstraction helped manage the complexity of your program.
_(Must not exceed 200 words)_


----

_Paste your program segmet here. This must be a part of your program that includes at least two other parts._

----

Describe how the algorithm manages complexity.
